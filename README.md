# libzstd-rs-sys

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the zstd file format. It aims to provide excellent performance while introducing memory safety.

## How to use

libzstd-rs-sys is in development and is not yet ready for use. 

We will release the decoder in early 2026 and the encoder (pending funding) later in the year.

## Performance

We track our performance at https://trifectatechfoundation.github.io/libzstd-rs-sys-bench/.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the [Zstandard reference implementation](https://github.com/facebook/zstd).
